        Social Scribe is a personal project that originated from an idea I had while participating in the Hashnode API Hackathon. 
        Although it didnâ€™t end up winning, the concept stayed with me, and I decided to bring it to life. 
        The goal was simple: automate sharing Hashnode blogs across X (Twitter) and LinkedIn, while adding features like scheduling 
        and AI-powered summaries.

        sx={{ textAlign: 'center', maxWidth: '800px', margin: '1rem auto', lineHeight: 1.6, fontWeight: 'bold' }}
      >
        What started as a hackathon idea is now something I continue to work on and improve, even if it's just for personal use 
        or to demonstrate what can be built with APIs, automation, and AI.
